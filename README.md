# SunloginLPE – Sunlogin Local Privilege Escalation Research

Topics: security, infosec, vulnerability-research, sunlogin, cve-analysis, windows-security, reverse-engineering, exploit-research, local-verification, analysis-tool, documentation

SunloginLPE is a **security research project** focused on analyzing the well-known Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability found in older versions of **Sunlogin Remote Control (Sunflower Remote Control)..**.  
The goal of this repository is to provide **educational insight**, **defensive understanding**, and **technical analysis** of the underlying issue—without distributing harmful exploit code.

> ⚠️ This project is strictly for **research, detection, and educational purposes**.  
> It does **not** include any working exploit, weaponized payloads, or instructions on abusing the vulnerability.

## 🔍 Overview

<img width="1147" height="688" alt="0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c24f78c6-892d-40ff-9839-f751902fd286" />

The Sunlogin LPE vulnerability became notable due to the ability for a local attacker to:
- Interact with the Sunlogin service,
- Abuse improper permission validations,
- And escalate privileges to SYSTEM on vulnerable builds.

This repository explains the **root cause**, demonstrates **safe reproduction in isolated lab environments**, and provides **guidance for defenders**.

## ❌ What This Project Does *Not* Contain

- ✘ No exploit code  
- ✘ No weaponized PoC  
- ✘ No steps for malicious usage  
- ✘ No methods to bypass updated versions  
- ✘ No binaries or automation tools  

This is a **security analysis project**, not an exploitation toolkit.

## 🛡 Defensive Perspective

Security teams can use the documentation in this repository to:

- Identify vulnerable Sunlogin versions  
- Monitor suspicious Sunlogin service activity  
- Detect privilege abuse attempts  
- Harden system configurations  
- Validate whether mitigations are active  

A dedicated *Defense* section describes IOC patterns, unusual log events, and telemetry recommendations.

---

## 📚 Background

The Sunlogin LPE issue originated from:
- Weak authorization validation in local API endpoints  
- Privileged operations exposed without proper checks  
- IPC interactions that allowed unintended elevation  

Several versions were affected prior to vendor fixes.
